### React Web Application

## Sample Pokedex

####Link to live app https://fluffy-starburst-490ccf.netlify.app/

This application allows the user to view data on Pokemon. Right now currently only pokemon's 1-493.

An api call is made to the PokeAPI in order to get the data that is used. 

There is a search bar that makes appropriate search on the pokemon obtained in the api call.

There is also a random pokemon button if you do not want to search.

In the future I think a moving banner at the bottom of the page would be nice to try to implement. As well as adding some more styling to make it look more visually appealing.
